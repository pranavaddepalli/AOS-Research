Three-dimensional (3D) printing has grown into a widely used technology for consumer and industrial use. Most commercial 3D printers use fused deposition modeling (FDM), a printing technique where a solid thermoplastic filament is repeatedly melted and extruded onto a two-dimensional layer to produce a 3D object. In FDM printing, thermal stresses between layers due to variable thermal conduction during cycles of heating and cooling create distortions, known as warpage. Various process variables, especially infill percentage and infill pattern, cause thermal properties to become anisotropic because of thermal conduction through plastic and natural convection in air gaps. In order to identify the effect of these process variables on thermal warpage, Polylactic Acid discs with multiple combinations of the process variables were printed and the spatiotemporal temperature distribution was modeled. Trajectory similarity analysis using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm as well as a temperature gradient analysis with statistical tests were applied to the data. With p-values <0.0001, it was found that tri-hexagonal infill patterns had more uniform temperature distributions when compared to rectilinear patterns. In addition, also with p-values <0.0001, 20% infill percentage was found to be the worst in uniforming temperature distribution when compared to 30% and 10% infill percentage, with 10% being the best. Increasing infill percentage was found to mitigate the effect of infill pattern, and the effect of increasing infill percentage was found to be decreasing with successive increases. Future work studying the dual role of natural convection and conduction in 3D printing could explain these results.
